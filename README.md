# Java_BrickGame

This is a game where the user gets a paddle to bounce a ball on the screen. When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears. Some bricks are special and they drop powers that make the paddle longer. When all the bricks disappear, you can move on to the next level. The difficulty (how many bricks there are in a level) can be configured via the settings page.
